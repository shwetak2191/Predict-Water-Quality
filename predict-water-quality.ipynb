Freshwater has hardness in the range of 15 to 375 ppm.\n\n**3.Solids**- Dissolved solids refer to any minerals ,salts,metals in water.Total dissolved solids comprise inorganic salts,calcium,magnesium,potassium etc.Desirable limit for TDS is 500 mg/l and maximum limit is 1000 mg/l which prescribed for drinking purpose\n\n**4.Sulfate**-Sulfate levels above 250 mg/L may make the water taste bitter or like medicine.People are not used to drink water with high sulfate it causes diarrhea and dehydration.\n\n**5 Chloramines**- Chloramine are the major disinfectants used in  water. Chloramines are most commonly formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water.Chlorine level up to 4 milligrams per liter are considered safe for drinking water.\n\n**6.Conductivity**-Pure water is not good conductor of electric current. This ability directly depends on the concentration of conductive ions in the water.\n\n**7.Organic_carbon**-TOC(Total organic carbon)is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water.Level of TOC are 0.05 ml/l or less.\n\n**8.Trihalomethanes**-Trihalomethane levels upto 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water.\n\n**9.Turbidity**-Turbidity is a measurement of solid matter being suspended in water.\nThe WHO  establishes that the turbidity of drinking water shouldn't be more than 5 NTU, and should ideally be below 1 NTU.\n\n**10.Potability**-It indicates if water is safe for drinking or not.1 means its potable and 0 means not potable.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.Data Understanding","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import
